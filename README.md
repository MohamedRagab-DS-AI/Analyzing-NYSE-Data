# Analyzing NYSE Data - Freelance Fast Forward (3Fs) Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing financial data from the **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)**, focusing on company performance over time. Through this analysis, I developed a dynamic dashboard for **Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement** and built a **Financial Forecasting Model**.

## Key Features
1. **Summary Statistics Analysis**  
   - Detailed exploration of the dataset (**IT Sector**) with central tendency and spread measures.
   - Focuses on identifying patterns and trends in financial performance.

2. **Dynamic P&L Dashboard**  
   - A user-friendly interface to select any company from the dataset and view its P&L metrics over time.
   - Provides insights into historical Gross Profit, Operating Profit (EBIT) for multiple years.

3. **Financial Forecasting Model**  
   - A flexible model to forecast financial performance for two years using three different growth scenarios.
   - Assumptions for each scenario are dynamically updated to reflect potential changes in revenue and margins.

## How to Use
1. **Open the NYSE.xlsx file**:
   - Navigate through the various tabs (Summary Statistics, P&L Dashboard, and Forecasting Model).
   - Use the drop-down list in the P&L Dashboard to select different ticker symbols.
   - In the Forecasting Model, choose between the Strong, Base, and Weak scenarios to view projected performance.

2. **Refer to insights.pdf**:
   - Review the insights and key takeaways from the analysis.
   - Visualizations and explanations are included to help interpret the results of the data analysis and forecasts.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Excel**: For data analysis, dynamic dashboard creation, and financial modeling.
- **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**: Applied to uncover trends and insights from the dataset.
- **Financial Modeling & Forecasting**: Created a flexible model to predict financial outcomes using different assumptions.
